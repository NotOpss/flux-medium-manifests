# Free and Automatic SSL Certificates in Kubernetes using CertÂ Manager
Getting an SSL certificate is not that easy. Moreover, it is expensive too. In today's world where Kubernetes is Predominantly everywhere. And with tonnes of Ingress resources in Kubernetes, it becomes really hard to get such a huge number of certificates, monitor them, and rotate them every time. This would be a nightmare for the DevOps Engineers. What if I tell you that there a tool that could get you free SSL certificates and rotate them automatically when they expire? Here comes Cert-Manager. Cert-manager was created by Jetstack, and a lot of the development is still sponsored by them. As per the cert-manager's official guide, the cert-manager is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as Let's Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, a simple signing key pair, or self-signed. It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.
